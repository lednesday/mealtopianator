# mealtopianator
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is a menu planning tool for groups

## Overview
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is a web app for collaboratively planning a series of shared group meals. Prototypical applications include multi-day river trips and group camping trips where the group shares responsiblity for preparing and eating the meals. In a typical situation, a trip planner will create a user account and a trip meal itinerary. Links to the itinerary can be sent to trip partipants, who will then sign up to prepare different meals and indicate the courses to be served. 

## The Stack
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is a distributed online app with a frontend user interface built within the Next.js framework. The backend consists of a Postgres database to manage and store user and meal itinerary information. 

## Contributors
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is developed and maintained by Chris Jones and Lindsay Jones Marean. 

## Known Bugs and Future Enhancements
We're working on our first MVP version of ***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator***, which will allow a person to create an account, log in, and create a meal with a name and description.
