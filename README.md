***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is a menu planning tool for groups

## Overview
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is a web app for collaboratively planning a series of shared group meals. Prototypical applications include multi-day river trips and group camping trips where the group shares responsiblity for preparing and eating the meals. In a typical situation, a trip planner will create a user account and a trip meal itinerary. Links to the itinerary can be sent to trip partipants, who will then sign up to prepare different meals and indicate the courses to be served. 

## The Stack
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is a distributed online app with a frontend user interface built with HTML, CSS, and Typescript using the React library. The backend consists of a NodeJS server and a NoSQL database to manage and store user and meal itinerary information. 

## Contributors
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** is developed and maintained by Chris Jones and Lindsay Jones Marean. 

## Known Bugs and Future Enhancements
***The Plantaculaganzic Mealtopianator*** has not been implemented. Future versions will have features.

# Next.js README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
. .env.local
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
